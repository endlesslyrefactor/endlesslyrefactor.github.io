    <p>
      Tonight I've decided to do some dev work on my laptop which has not worked
      on this repo before. Immediately I hit some problems
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly I needed to install a newer version of node via <code>nvm</code>.
      The download seemed to work but <code>npm install</code> threw an error
      about <code>npm-cli</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>think</i> that the installer was failing to update the path variable
      for node because a home automation script was running in node at the same
      time
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end the fix was quite simple. I updated <code>nvm</code> and
      rebooted my machine to be safe. And then uninstalled and reinstalled the
      version of node I wanted to use
    </p>
    <p>
      That let me install packaged but running the server threw errors because
      <code>main.js</code> couldn't be found. I realised I had installed
      TypeScript globally on the other machine which didn't seem like the best
      idea. I added it to the <code>packages.json</code> so it would be
      installed automatically from now on
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        npm install typescript --save-dev
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then I remembered that I was missing something obvious from the readme. I
      added a section about running <code>npx tsc</code> to build the TypeScript
    </p>
    <p>
      After all that I feel like I should just do something simple tonight. I
      will try and extend a todo so it is a description
    </p>
    <p>
      As a description is just another string backed value object I created a
      <code>TodoDescription</code> based off the <code>TodoName</code> code I
      already had. But I increased the maximum allowable size to 500. That
      number was picked from thin air but it should be very easy to chain later
    </p>
    <p>
      I then added the description to the <code>Todo</code> class and modified
      the tests and the main file to know about them
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I will call it there tonight. Next I should make the description
      editable and make a UI to set it
    </p>
