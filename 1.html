    <h1>1: C#, hiding a helper class except from the class it is helping</h1>
    <p>
      There have been a few occasions where I have come up been writing a class
      and thought that another class would provide a useful abstraction. But
      when you've written this helper class you realise that it has no use
      outside of the original class, or the concept could be confusing in a
      different context
    </p>
    <p>
      Limiting the visiblity of the helper class can avoid these problems. The
      main class could have access to the abstraction with no risk of it being
      mistakenly used elsewhere later
    </p>
    <p>A very simple way of doing this is to nest the classes</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        public class MainClass
        {
          public static bool MainMethod()
          {
            var x = new HelperClass();
            return false;
          } 
          
          private class HelperClass
          {

          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In my experience a lot of developers instinctively dislike having multiple
      classes in a single file like this. Personally I don't mind it in this
      case but I'm all for keeping my code files short and hiding the details of
      abstractions until I want to know what they are. What I want is the helper
      to be in a different file
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time I couldn't think of a way of doing this. Recently I
      realised it could use a C# feature I hadn't thought about in years,
      partial classes
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        public partial class MainClass 
        {
          public static bool MainMethod() 
          {
            var x = new HelperClass();
            return false;
          }
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <br />
    <pre>
      <code>
        public partial class MainClass 
        { 
          private class HelperClass 
          {
          } 
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      I haven't used this in the wild yet (I'm currently working on a Python
      project), but it seems like this would give me the visibility restriction
      without bloating the files
