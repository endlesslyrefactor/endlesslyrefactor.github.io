    <p>
      Today I'm going to try and work out how to make a todo editable in place.
      The idea of in place editing is something I've liked the idea of for a
      while. I've worked on some software which have highly configurable UIs
      which were edited in separate screens. It always felt a bit clunky from
      the user's point of view and it felt like there was a lot of code
      duplication too. This feels like a good way to try in place editing out on
      a simple domain
    </p>
    <p>So, to start with I best add an edit button</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &ltform id=${"todo-" + todo.id.value}&gt
          &lth3&gt${todo.name.value}&lt/h3&gt
          &ltp&gt${todo.description.value}&lt/p&gt
          &ltp&gt${todo.createdAt.displayString}&lt/p&gt
          &ltinput type="button" value="edit"/&gt
          &ltinput type="submit" value="x"/&gt
        &lt/form&gt
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Wait, we live in the future. I can have a nice edit emoji as the value instead of the word "edit". There's probably a better "x" available too</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &ltinput type="button" value="üñã"/&gt
        &ltinput type="submit" value="‚ùå"/&gt
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Hmmm. I like the cross but all the edit options are a bit pants. The cog looks more like a target to me so I went with a pen. I'll probably revisit this later as it's not very accessible at the moment</p>
    <p>Next, I'm not sure I like the new input being of type button. Maybe it should be a second submit? Stack overflow says there's something called a formaction, maybe that's what I want?</p>
    <p>Currently I think that button is fine as it is not submitting the form to the server. But maybe the delete and the future save on the form should be a formaction</p>
    <p>Next I need to sort out the events for these new buttons. There was a bit of back and forth with this and as I didn't write this as I went along I've probably forgotten some of the twiddly bits</p>
    <p>I have given the current todo form a classname events from it can easily be identified later</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        &ltform id=${"todo-" + todo.id.value} class="todo-view"&gt&lt/form&gt
      </code>
    </pre>
  </body>
  <p>I also changed the submit value from ‚ùå to üóë</p>
  <p>I then made a new form for editing a todo</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &ltform id=${"todo-" + todo.id.value} class="todo-editor"&gt
        &ltinput&gt${todo.name.value}&lt/input&gt
        &ltinput&gt${todo.description.value}&lt/input&gt
        &ltinput&gt${todo.createdAt.displayString}&lt/input&gt
        &ltinput type="button" value="‚ùå"/&gt
        &ltinput type="submit" value="‚úî"/&gt
      &lt/form&gt
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>I also moved these forms into their own render function which is called by the map. This render function has an if statement to decide whether to render the view or the editor. I couldn't work out how to get a conditional to work inside of the string template, but looking at it now I think the method improves things anyway</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      function RenderTodo(todo: Todo) : WiredTemplateFunction {
        if (todoBeingEdited === todo.id.value)
            return hyper.wire(todo)`
                &ltform id=${"todo-" + todo.id.value} class="todo-editor"&gt
                    &ltinput&gt${todo.name.value}&lt/input&gt
                    &ltinput&gt${todo.description.value}&lt/input&gt
                    &ltinput&gt${todo.createdAt.displayString}&lt/input&gt
                    &ltinput type="button" value="‚ùå"/&gt
                    &ltinput type="submit" value="‚úî"/&gt
                &lt/form&gt
            `
    
        return hyper.wire(todo)`
            &ltform id=${"todo-" + todo.id.value} class="todo-view"&gt
                &lth3&gt${todo.name.value}&lt/h3&gt
                &ltp&gt${todo.description.value}&lt/p&gt
                &ltp&gt${todo.createdAt.displayString}&lt/p&gt
                &ltinput type="button" value="üñã"/&gt
                &ltinput type="submit" value="üóë"/&gt
            &lt/form&gt
        `
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Next I moved on to the events. As there are now two types of submit event (one to delete and one to save) I need to do different things depending where they come from. Each match starts by preventing any further events and ends with re-rendering all the todos, but in the middle they do something different. In time I think there's a refactor to be done to reduce this boiler plate but the code I've written will be fine for now</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      container.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
        const target = <HTMLInputElement>e.target

        if (target.className === 'todo-view') {
            e.preventDefault()
    
            const target = <HTMLElement>e.target
            const idIndex = target.id.indexOf('-')
    
            const todoId = target.id.substring(idIndex + 1)
    
            todoCollection.delete(todoId)
            RenderTodos(todoCollection)
        }

        if (target.className === 'todo-editor') {
            e.preventDefault()
    
            // TODO: save the details

            todoBeingEdited = ''
            RenderTodos(todoCollection)
            return
        }
      })
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>I then did a similar thing for the edit and discard buttons. The setup was the same but again the core of each handler is different</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      container.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
        const target = <HTMLButtonElement>e.target

        if (target.value === 'üñã') {
            e.preventDefault()
    
            const idIndex = target.parentElement.id.indexOf('-')
    
            todoBeingEdited = target.parentElement.id.substring(idIndex + 1)
            RenderTodos(todoCollection)
            return
        }

        if (target.value === '‚ùå') {
            e.preventDefault()
    
            todoBeingEdited = ''
            RenderTodos(todoCollection)
            return
        }
      })
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>That feels like a good place to leave things. Next I need to actually save the results from the editor. I could just have this create a new todo but in the future I'll probably want some history and that would mess with it. I will probably end up adding a new method to a todo which takes in an edit form and updates all the values. Maybe only if they've changed. As all the properties are very strongly typed I shouldn't have to worry about any validation being skipped</p>
