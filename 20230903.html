    <h1>Todo app #5</h1>
    <p>2023-09-03</p>
    <p>[JavaScript]</p>
    <p>To start with today I think I'll just do something simple. I'll add the ability to delete a todo. I'll probably end up replacing the code later on today but sometimes you just need something to get your brain working</p>
    <p>First I should add a delete button to the HTML for each todo</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function RenderTodos(todos: Array<Todo>) : void {
          let container = document.getElementById('todo-container')
      
          hyper.bind(container)`${
              todos.map((todo, index) =&gt hyper.wire(todo)`
                  &ltform&gt
                      &lth3&gt${todo.name.value}&lt/h3&gt
                      &ltinput type="submit" id=${"todo-" + index} value="x"/&gt
                  &lt/form&gt
              `)
            }`
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>To wire up the click events I went for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/event-delegation-javascript/">event delegation</a> (this is a concept I really need to remember the name of). This means that I can add the event to the <code>todo-container</code> at the start and it will work for all buttons inside that container whenever they are added. This should be much simpler than adding an event each time we render a todo and having to make sure we don't add multiple. As a minor side effect it should mean less CPU and memory are used by the app</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function AddTodoEvents(): void {
          let container = document.getElementById('todo-container')
      
          container.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
              e.preventDefault()
      
              let submitterIndex = parseInt(e.submitter.id.split('-')[1])
              todos.splice(submitterIndex, 1)
              
              RenderTodos(todos)
          })
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>It seems that I hit some minor HTML inconsistencies with my code (that term is probably a bit harsh). It looks like <code>e.target</code> doesn't return the submit button, but instead it returns the form which contains the submit button. Hence in my case I need to use <code>e.submitter</code> instead of <code>e.target</code></p>
    <p>And finally I need to add those events when the page first loads</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
          RenderForm()
          AddTodoEvents()
          ....
        })
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Having typed that up though it seems like putting the index id on the form makes more sense than on the submit button. I'll change it</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function RenderForm(errorMessage: string = '') : void {
          let container = document.getElementById('form-container')
      
          hyper.bind(container)`
              &lth1&gttodo app&lt/h1&gt
              &lth2&gtAdd todo&lt/h2&gt
              &ltform id="add-form"&gt
                  &ltp style="color: red"&gt${errorMessage}&lt/p&gt
                  &ltinput type="text" id="add-name" name="name"/&gt
                  &ltinput type="submit" value="add"/&gt
              &lt/form&gt
          `
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function AddTodoEvents(): void {
          let container = document.getElementById('todo-container')
      
          container.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
              e.preventDefault()
      
              let target = &ltHTMLElement&gte.target
              let targetIndex = parseInt(target.id.split('-')[1])
              
              todos.splice(targetIndex, 1)
      
              RenderTodos(todos)
          })
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>This wasn't <i>quite</i> as easy as I was hoping. The target of the event in the handler was too general for TypeScript's taste. Whatever type it was didn't have an <code>id</code> property on it. I needed to cast the target to a <code>HtmlElement</code> before I could use it. Not the end of the world and I still think <code>id</code> makes most sense at the <code>form</code> level</p>
    <p>Now I'll just fix a minor thing which is bugging me as I manually yesy this code, the text in the add form doesn't clear after the submit is fired</p>
    <p>Here's the method which will wipe the input:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        function ClearAddFormInput() : void {
          (document.getElementById('add-name') as HTMLInputElement).value = ''
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Which is called as part of the add event:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        document.getElementById('add-form').addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
          e.preventDefault()
  
          let formInput = GetAddFormInput()
  
          let errorMessage = ''
  
          try {
              let todo = new Todo(formInput)
              todos.push(todo)
  
              ClearAddFormInput()
              RenderTodos(todos)
          }
          ...
        })
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>I added a new method instead of a one-liner as starting a statement with a bracket doesn't play nice with the semi-colonless JavaScript I'm trying to write. Thankfully my editor spits out a warning when I do this. Not a terribly helpful warning (something about numbers) but it's better than the old days where I would only know about it at runtime</p>
    <p>I think now I'm going to turn the array into a domain object. This should allow be to encapsulate the sorting and filtering behaviour I will need soon, and allow me to have some better identifiers than the array index</p>
    <p>Firstly I'll write a test for creating the new class. I've decided to use a static factory method as I'm almost certain I'll want more than one kind of constructor in the future (maybe a rehydrate and a new, maybe different ones for different types of todo). But also I do just like them more than plain constructors</p>
    <p>The test just checks that when we call the factory method there are no todos in the collection:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        describe('create', () => {
          it('returns an empty collection', () => {
              let sut = TodoCollection.create()

              expect(sut.todos).toEqual(new Array&ltTodo&gt())
          })
        })
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>And then I needs to write an implementation that passes:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        import Todo from "./todo"

        class TodoCollection {
            #todos: Array<Todo>

            private constructor () {
                this.#todos = new Array<Todo>()
            }
            
            public static create () : TodoCollection {
                return new TodoCollection()
            }
            
            get todos() {
                return this.#todos;
            }
        }

        export default TodoCollection
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Next I want to be able to add a todo to the collection. Here's a test for it:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        describe('add', () => {
          it('adds a todo to the collection', () => {
              let testTodo = new Todo(new AddFormInput("test todo name"))
              let sut = TodoCollection.create()
      
              sut.add(testTodo)
      
              expect(sut.todos).toEqual(new Array&ltTodo&gt(testTodo))
          })
        })
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>At on that I'm going to have to call it a day as time has gotten away from me. This might be a blessing in disguise. A few times in the past I've worked on code where I could end the day with a broken test. It makes it very clear what you should start on the next day</p>
