    <h1>Todo app #11</h1>

    <p>
      Today I feel I should continue with where I left off. Firstly I'll write a
      test check that the new description on a todo is editable
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        describe('updateDescription', () => {
          it('sets the description', () => {
              const expectedDescription = TodoDescription.create('expected description')
              const sut = new Todo(
                  () => ImmutableDate.create(), new AddFormInput(validName, 'orignial description')
              )
      
              sut.updateDescription(expectedDescription)
      
              expect(sut.description.value).toBe(expectedDescription.value)
          })
        })
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Obviously that test fails at the moment as
      <code>updateDescription</code> doesn't exist
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        public updateDescription(newDescription: TodoDescription) : void {
          this.#description = newDescription
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The test now passes so I should work on making the description visible in
      the UI
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding the description to the todo UI was a simple one-liner in
      <code>RenderTodos</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <p>${todo.description.value}</p>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Adding the description to the form required a couple of similar
      one-liners. Basically each line which referred to
      <code>add-name</code> needed a corresponding line for
      <code>add-description</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      When testing the code I ran into a minor error. If I filled in the name
      for a new todo correctly but had an invalid value for description, then
      the error message I got was
      <code>Name (22) must be between 5 and 500 characters</code>. I'm sure I've
      just made a copy-paste error somewhere with the description
    </p>
    <p>
      Yep. Seconds after typing that I open the <code>TodoDescription</code> and
      immediately see that line 33 specifically starts the error message with
      "Name". Nice and easy to fix
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I will leave it there today. Next I feel like I should make
      created todos editable. I think that ideally I would have the todo
      switched out in place with a form
    </p>
